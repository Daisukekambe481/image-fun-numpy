# ðŸ“š Image Fun with NumPy â€“ Project Documentation


This folder contains **all technical and implementation documentation** for the project.
It is organized so each component has its own dedicated file to avoid clutter and merge conflicts.

## ðŸ—‚ What Goes Where


### **1. `architecture/`**
For **big-picture** system documentation.


- **`sequence_diagram.png`** â€“ Visual flow of the image processing steps (load â†’ transform â†’ filter â†’ output).


### **2. `implementation/`**
For **component-level** implementation guidance. Each file is a **guidance doc** for researching, deciding, and implementing a specific feature.


| File | Purpose |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `loader.md` | Loading & inspecting images, verifying shape, sample pixels |
| `transformations.md` | Flip horizontally/vertically, rotate 90Â°, use NumPy slicing |
| `grayscale.md` | Grayscale conversion using `np.mean`, display with matplotlib |
| `color_ops.md` | Invert, brighten/darken, isolate color channels |
| `filters.md` | Blur, sharpen, edge detection using convolution kernels |
| `effects.md` | Fun effects: mosaic, thresholding, noise, glitch |
| `implementation_guidance.md` | Research guidance, naming conventions, and reusable code patterns |

## ðŸ›  How to Contribute to Documentation


1. **Pick the correct file** â€” Only edit the file related to your change.
2. **Be specific** â€” Keep updates scoped to your component.
3. **Avoid unrelated changes** â€” One commit = one component update.
4. **Use Markdown headings** â€” Keep structure clear for navigation.
5. **Commit messages** â€” Follow clear convention:


```
docs(loader): add sample pixel inspection
docs(transformations): update flip/rotate examples
docs(filters): add Sobel filter example
```
